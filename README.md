# A-Brief-Analysis-On-the-Success-Rates-of-IPL-Teams-
Here, three Indian Premier League (IPL) teams are considered - CSK,MI and KKR 

Here, a comparative analysis is made on the performances (success rates) of the cricket teams in Indian Premier League (IPL).

The three IPL teams considered are as follows -  
1) Chennai Super Kings (CSK) 
2) Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR)
3) Mumbai Indians (MI) 

Three datasets were referred to for this project. All three are from Wikipedia. 
Here are the links to the datasets: 
1) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kolkata_Knight_Riders_records#By_season 
2) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians#Overall_results_in_the_IPL
3) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chennai_Super_Kings_records#By_season 

The graph was plotted ensuring Cairo's four principles: 
The entire choice of a bar graph was in order to cover Cairo's principle of truthfulness. This was because any other choice of a plot would have seemed to be quite misleading and would not have given the clear visual of a comparative analysis.
Cairo's principle of beauty was efficiently utilized in choosing an appealing outlook to the plot and using appropriately pleasing visuals such as the bar colors, sufficiently clear labels, a legend and so on.
The idea of the entire bar graph was to give a comparative performance analysis and not a statistical insight into each individual team's performance. 
Therefore by looking at the bar plot's one cannot make out the success rate values of each team's performance. This was done deliberately to avoid irrelevant information. This is where Cairo's principle of functionality comes into play.
Cairo's principle of insightfulness - The entire presentation of the bar chart gives an in-depth clarity of a comparative analysis of performances. 
Thus, I vouch for the bar graph to give a complete insight into the purpose for which it was originally designed.
